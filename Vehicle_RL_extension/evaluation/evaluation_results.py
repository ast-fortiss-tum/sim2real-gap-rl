"""
Author: Cristian Cubides
This script generates a performance table from runs using poses.json and moving.json files.
It computes the cumulative turning until the computed cross-track error (CTE) exceeds a survival threshold,
and for each of three safe thresholds, the percentage of turning during that period where CTE was safe.
It also computes the mean speed and maximum CTE observed during the run.
Runs are grouped by the subfolder in which they reside.
The poses JSON is expected to contain keys "pose", "time", and "lanes".
The moving JSON is expected to contain keys "going" and "time".
Timestamps are used to decide which pose points are “going.” Processing stops as soon as
the survival threshold is reached.
